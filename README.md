# Code challenge Data Revenue

I created a local pipenv to keep track of all the libraries used in every step (dockerized), and run code for debugging
from my machine.

        pipenv --python 3.6
        pipenv install -r download_data/requirements.txt
        pipenv install -r orchestrator/requirements.txt
